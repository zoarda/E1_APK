1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,903
We have to work hard for our studio's survival.

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,072
Let's wrap up this meeting.

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,109
I'll send everyone the script a little later.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,679
All right. I want to ask each of you to make sure you take care of your own preparation work.

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,347
Thank you for your hard work.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,917
Cherry

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,785
Please stay here.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,786
Have a seat.

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,054
I have something I want to talk to you about.

10
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:21,588
All right.

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,323
Can you give me a minute.

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,096
Wow, thank you.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:35,969
Thank you.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,871
How did you know that I like to drink iced Americano.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,975
Please. You even drink Iced Americano during the Winter storms.

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,244
I see you drinking it every time.

17
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,345
It makes me feel so cold.

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,746
That's true.

19
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,315
Well, this time.

20
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,218
Will your husband not be able to stand it?

21
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,653
My husbandâ€¦

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,956
Maybe before he couldn't.

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,261
We haven't spoken in days.

24
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:01,995
Huh?

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,663
I'm sorry to hear that..

26
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,098
I didn't want to say anything.

27
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,367
It's okay. Work is just work.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,169
Anyways.

29
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,273
I've done travel shoots for people before.

30
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:17,510
But this is the first time I'm doing a porno.

31
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,646
Really?

32
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,782
For shooting these sex scenes

33
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,751
We need to find some reference pictures as examples.

34
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,754
Otherwise, we will just be communicating on the fly as we shoot.

35
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
And it will be difficult to explain what we want by words.
