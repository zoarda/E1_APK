1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:01,668
Are you stupid?

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,903
I'm not asking you to act or role play.

3
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,272
It's just like how we shoot our regular movies.

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,975
Oh, yeah that's right.

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,244
But I haven't seen or watched it before.

6
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,146
It makes me feel awkward and shy.

7
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,714
Don't worry about it, it will be alright.

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,850
When we used to make experimental movies.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,718
You've done nude shoots before.

10
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,754
That was different.

11
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,123
OK. Ok

12
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,725
Just trust me this time.

13
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,360
Is that okay?

14
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,998
still

15
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,266
let me buy you some ice cream.

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,734
Just two of us.

17
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,472
But Rosie and others will want some too!

18
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,375
Oh, it's all right, don't worry.

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,578
Let me act like I'm comforting you.

20
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,049
I'll just walk you to the top floor, alright?

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,484
Come on, let's go.

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,290
Lets go!

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,931
Just act like you are sad.

24
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,456
Stop launghing!
