1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:03,737
Are you okay

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,404
today?

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:05,872
Of course I am

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,708
Look how beautiful I made Bebe look with her makeup

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,810
It's really good not bad at all

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,413
today?

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,082
Are you tired

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,751
from earlier?

9
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,386
Omg…Argh

10
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,887
stop talking about it

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,722
Ugh….!

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,426
Are you free after work?

13
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,228
Why don't you join me for a drink

14
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,631
After all we've been working hard for so many days

15
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,682
You look like you were enjoying yourself at work today

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,919
Did you forget that you were at work?

17
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,488
I had no choice

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,589
It's just acting

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,891
Acting.....Acting

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:58,758
I know how to do it too.

21
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,826
That's what I ask of from my actors too

22
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:00,760
Is that a good

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,261
way to perform?

24
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,862
Oh

25
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,663
Oh, really?

26
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,698
Well then, I'm sorry to have to put you through this

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,867
The wine here is very good.

28
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,136
but

29
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,171
I think

30
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,605
that this will get me drunk

31
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:13,706
And yours?
