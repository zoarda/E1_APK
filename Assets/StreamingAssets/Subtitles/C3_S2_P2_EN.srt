1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:02,225
but

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:03,850
Do you want to try a sip?

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,125
It's really sweet.

4
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:13,375
It's too sweet for me

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,275
Yeah

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,900
it's as sweet as you

7
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:21,400
That

8
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,200
joke how old is it

9
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,850
What's wrong

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:28,775
but

11
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,700
So what's trending now?

12
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,750
Do you want to go to the next place?

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,100
today?

14
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:39,450
seems like

15
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:40,875
It's quite late.

16
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,150
Yeah, it's kind of late

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,550
I think we're all tired from working all day

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,575
Is the director buying?

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,175
Ahh

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,475
Thank you director

21
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,725
Well, I'll see you at the wrap up party I guess.

22
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:56,475
Thank you

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,600
Hey

24
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:58,275
Ughâ€¦.!
