1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,225
What about your husband?

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:04,400
I remember

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,775
you've been married for about three or four years?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,175
It's just that our work and lifestyle routine doesn't match up!

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,475
We

6
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,975
have been sleeping in different rooms for awhile now.

7
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,200
I see

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,525
but

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,800
In that case

10
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:23,575
if you feel lonely

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,350
you can call me!

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,675
What are you saying

13
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,700
you're so gross

14
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,425
Don't just think you can talk like that, just because you were in a porno

15
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,175
No not that.

16
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,250
I was just teasing and joking

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,300
Don't be so serious.

18
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:41,150
Forget about it!

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,950
You wouldn't understand anyways

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,425
Are you ok

21
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,550
Do you want me to give you a ride home?

22
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,475
It's all right.

23
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:03,975
I'll just take the bus home myself.

24
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,700
I guess we'll be busy with editing tomorrow.

25
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:11,825
Go home and get some rest.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
You sure you're ok

27
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:14,350
are you sure?

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,525
Yes
