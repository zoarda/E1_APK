1
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:02,208
Alright

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:03,843
don't think about it too much.

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,011
Next

4
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:06,012
those videos just

5
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:07,614
give them to the editing team.

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,251
Wow!

7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,586
you

8
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,088
want to have another drink?

9
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:17,223
Sure thank you.

10
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,293
Boss man another round!

11
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:26,166
Wow!

12
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:27,967
Here you go…here you go…..

13
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,637
Thank you so much!

14
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,339
Cheers

15
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:33,840
ok

16
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,376
Cheers

17
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,126
Did you know

18
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:55,795
Me and my husband

19
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:59,632
because of our work

20
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,568
our lifestyle routines are different.

21
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,737
We've been sleeping in different rooms for awhile now,

22
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,675
But we're in the movie business

23
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,543
and it's hard work

24
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,748
If I get to have a meal with him just once a week

25
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,617
It is a luxury to me.

26
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:21,221
He said how can we even have a baby!

27
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:23,523
but

28
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,124
It's getting pretty late.

29
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:25,825
so…

30
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:26,926
Let's call it a day

31
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:28,094
and hurry up and go home.

32
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:31,130
One Day

33
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:32,932
won't change anything.

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,100
and

35
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:35,168
At this hour

36
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:37,737
he's already in bed and asleep.

37
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:40,373
and I've been drinking.

38
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,308
I don't want to go home!

39
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:44,143
but

40
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:45,278
Don't tell me

41
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,313
you're going back to the office to sleep.

42
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,484
Then can you help find me a hotel?

43
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,686
As long as there's a bed I'll be good.

44
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:55,455
I'm a little drunk!

45
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:03,196
Be careful.

46
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:03,863
Be careful.

47
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:07,967
Are you ok

48
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,207
Let's go to the bed.

49
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,243
To the bed

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,745
Ok…ok...

51
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,379
Let's go…go..go

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,246
Watch your step

53
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:20,947
be carful.

54
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:21,614
hold on tight.

55
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:30,957
Ok…Ok…..Ok

56
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:31,424
Sit here first…..

57
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,158
Take a seat

58
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:32,659
Take a seat

59
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:36,596
Ok…Ok…..Ok

60
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,697
Have a seat for a little bit

61
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:39,032
I'll go get you some water!

62
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:39,465
Go…...

63
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:40,633
No….No….

64
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:41,501
No…

65
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,539
Keep me company for just a little longer

66
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,585
don't leave yet.

67
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,820
Kiss me….

68
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,255
What! You're drunk!

69
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,091
Stop talking!

70
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,810
My ears

71
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:12,892
I want it

72
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,560
I want it

73
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:15,695
I want!

74
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:21,234
I want!

75
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:50,496
Wait….Wait

76
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:51,431
Wait….Wait

77
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,299
What's wrong?
78
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,468
Your cell phone is ringing.

79
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:57,603
It's ok….

80
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:58,304
Who cares..... Don't worry about it.

81
00:04:59,072 --> 00:04:59,739
Just ignore it!

82
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,473
Just ignore it!

83
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:04,644
Are you sure......?

84
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:06,512
It's ok….

85
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,565
Your cell phone keeps ringing.

86
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,801
Wait….Wait

87
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:35,508
Hello

88
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:40,513
Yes

89
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:41,647
We just called it a day.

90
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:46,753
I'll be home a little later.

91
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,557
Okay, go to bed

92
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:53,459
ok

93
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:55,661
good night

94
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,095
Goodbye

95
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:03,169
Your husband?

96
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:04,804
Nothing, it's fine.

97
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:06,873
Everything is fine.

98
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,043
I said we

99
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,580
....Never mind it's nothing.

100
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:16,449
I know what you mean

101
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:16,849
but

102
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,050
You'd better go home.

103
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:18,885
but

104
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:19,952
See you at the warap up party.
